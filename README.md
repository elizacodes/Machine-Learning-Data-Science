# Machine Learning & Data Science

Welcome! This is my page specifically for my journey to study Machine Learning and Data Science. A lot of the notes provided in here are mainly for my use only and this is not in any way meant to be an educational route. This is solely to store my notebooks, programs, and notes following up my journey into ML/DS. The notes provided are from the following courses:

- **Zero to Mastery**:
  - [Python Developer 2023](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-python/)
